<h2>Visible 1.0</h2>

10/2003

<h3>System Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Disable computer and hard drive sleep from System Preferences. Video capture process will fail if the system goes to sleep. Display sleep does not have to be disabled.
<li>Do NOT run any other user applications during video capture. 
<li>Video analysis requires large amounts of memory so 2 GB of RAM is recommended for best performance.
</ul>

<h3>Licensing</h3>
<ul>
<li>License file format has been changed and Visible 0.92 license files will not work any more. A new license file will have to be generated by Reify.
</ul>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<ul>
<li>Visible 1.0 is an early beta version with limited functionality.
<li>Visible 1.0 video capture duration is limited to 524288 frames. All captures in Reify format can be analyzed without limits. However, when movies in Quicktime format are analyzed, Visible will attempt to load all video frames into memory for analysis and OS X virtual memory size is limited to 3 GB. If video frame size is 1280x960, the maximum analyzable movie length is 1000-2000 frames depending on analysis operation.
<li>If motion graphics are produced during Functional visual analysis, they may consume large amounts of memory depending on input data. Each motion vector graphic token consumes 20 bytes so a video frame containing a vector field of 100 000 vectors would consume 2 MB of memory...thus no more than 1500 such frames can be analyzed without exhausting all virtual memory.
<li>Reify Experiment Markup Language (.rfyeml) is at a preliminary stage and it is subject to change. It cannot be guaranteed that future product versions can read old .rfyeml result files. However, results can be saved in comma-separated-value CSV format for easy Excel-import.
<li>Reify Experiment Markup Language (.rfyeml) result files contain the path name of the analyzed movie. If the movie cannot be found in its original location, Visible will attempt to find it in the same directory where .rfyeml file is located.
</ul>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added new analysis operation <code>Functional visual analysis</code>.
<li>Added new analysis operation <code>Muscle cell analysis</code>.
<li>Added new entropy definition settings for entropy analysis operations:
  <ol>
    <li>ACI
    <li>Visual Entropy
    <li>Diffusion Index
  </ol>
<li>Added settings to choose first and last video frame to analyze; subsets of frames within the movie can now be analyzed.
<li>Added <code>View</code> menu in menu bar. It contains two items:
  <ol>
    <li>Locomotive Body Graphical Data Display
    <li>Locomotive Body Text Data Display
  </ol>
<li>Added new item <code>Open Experiment Template</code> in File menu.
<li>Added new item <code>New Experiment</code> in File menu.
<li>Added new settings tab <code>Visualize</code> which contains movie playback controls and settings for functional visual analysis data visualization.
<li>Added new settings tab <code>Export</code> which contains settings to control result data export.
<li>Added new "rectangle zoom" mode in video monitor.
<li>ACI sliding window graph is now displayed during capture preview and analysis.
<li>ACI sliding window settings can now be changed during capture preview.
<li>Added new settings under <code>Experiment</code> settings tab: imaging mode, temperature, CO2 level, O2 level, treatment2.
<li>Experiment settings are now stored in <code>.rfymov</code> files instead of <code>.rfyeml</code> files.
<li>Added new capture information text display areas under <code>Capture</code> settings tab: camera information, capture data information, capture conversion information.

</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes and Enhancements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changed some experiment settings from text fields to menu choices: cell/organism type, lens magnification, other magnification.
<li>Improved stability.
<li>Improved video and graphics display speed.
</ul>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>On rare occasions a few video frames may be lost at the beginning of video capture. If this happens, an error dialog about dropped frames will be displayed when the capture has finished. This does not corrupt captured video or measurement data of the session, it just means that some frames may have a longer than usual frame duration.
</ul>

<h2>Visible 0.92</h2>

02/2003

<h3>System Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Disable computer and hard drive sleep from System Preferences. Video capture process will fail if the system goes to sleep. Display sleep does not have to be disabled.
<li>Do NOT run any other user applications during video capture. 
<li>Video analysis requires large amounts of memory so 2 GB of RAM is recommended for best performance.
</ul>


<h3>Limitations</h3>

<ul>
<li>Visible 0.92 is an early alpha version with limited functionality.
<li>Visible product license is bound to OS X host ID which is generated from primary IP address. Thus if the IP address of the machine changes, the license will not work and a new license must be generated.
<li>Visible 0.92 video capture duration is limited only by available disk space. However, during analysis Visible will attempt to load all video frames into memory for analysis and OS X virtual memory size is limited to 3 GB. If video frame size is 1280x960, the maximum analyzable movie length is 1000-2000 frames.
<li>Reify Experiment Markup Language (.rfyeml) is at a preliminary stage and it is subject to change. It cannot be guaranteed that future product versions can read old .rfyeml result files. However, results can be saved in comma-separated-value CSV format for easy Excel-import.
<li>Reify Experiment Markup Language (.rfyeml) result files contain the absolute path name of the analyzed movie. Thus if the captured movie is renamed or moved after analysis results have been saved, loading the result  file into Visible will fail because the movie cannot be located.
</ul>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>On rare occasions a few video frames may be lost at the beginning of video capture. If this happens, an error dialog about dropped frames will be displayed when the capture has finished. This does not corrupt captured video or measurement data of the session, it just means that some frames may have a longer than usual frame duration.
